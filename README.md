# Skin-Melanoma-Prediction

This project predicts the probability of a given image being a skin cancer (melanoma) or not. I have used Convolutional Neural Network to build a binary classification model, trained and validated using image dataset containing about 33000 images. I have performed EDA on the dataset, and build the model to predict only the Melanoma class. The goal of this project is to help detecting cancer at an early age using images, which greatly helps in early treatment of cancer. Please make use of the pdf file for further details on the project.

# Installation

This project was built using Python 3.10.10 version. However, it can be run on a lower version of Python by making necessary changes in the code.

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Install the required dependencies and libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
3) Run the main.ipynb file from the main branch. It will perform all the data cleaning, EDA, build the CNN model, and create an .h5 file. This weights of the trained model are saved in the .h5 file, which will be used in the predictor app.
4) You can use the skin-melanoma-predictor branch to create the app. Run the app.py file in a suitable environment. It will create the app on the local machine. Upload any relevant image and see the predicted class.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project can be found in the below link. It contains images for training and validation.
